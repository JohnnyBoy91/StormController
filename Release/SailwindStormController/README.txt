This mod allows customization of wave & storm parameters

Installation: copy the SailwindStormController folder into your Mods folder

Uninstallation: delete the SailwindStormController folder from your Mods folder

INSTRUCTIONS:
This mod contains a "config" text file. You can adjust the values in the config file to control how waves are generated etc.
Changes to the config require restarting Sailwind to take effect.
I included a copy of the config with the default values as well as a brief description of what each does if you need a reference.
If you have the modconsole mod installed you can use the following console commands in this mod-
"givemestorm" 	- gives you a storm at your location
"givemestorm_X" - gives you a storm at your location with a radius of X(default is around 3000 or so)
